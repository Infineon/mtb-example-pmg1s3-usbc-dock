## Build flow

The EZ-PD&trade; PMG1-S3 USB-C Dock solution architecture supports asymmetric dual firmware images with a bootstrap image. The bootstrap image is available in the *bootstrap* directory of the application's root directory. Do the following to build and create a composite HEX file:

1. Build the application using one of the following methods. This will start the Firmware-1 build operation.

   <details><summary><b>Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

   Click the **Build Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **Project** > **Build Project**).
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Command line</b></summary>
   From the terminal, execute the `make build` command to build the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile.

   Example:
   ```
   make build -j8
   ```
   </details>

2. On completion of the build, the post-build script for Firmware 1 is executed. This generates a *.cyacd2* file for Firmware 1 and triggers the Firmware 2 build operation.

3. At the end of the Firmware 2 build operation, the post-build script is invoked again to generate the *.cyacd2* file for Firmware 2 and create a composite HEX file consisting of Bootstrap, Firmware-1 and Firmware-2 images using **cymcuelftool**.


## Operation

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=APP_<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=APP_PMG1S3DUAL TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

3. After programming, the application starts automatically.

</details>

## Design and implementation

In this reference solution, the PMG1-S3 MCU is both a dock management controller (DMC) and PD controller. It provides the DMC functionality and controls two USB-C ports.  When the device powers up, it executes the bootstrap image first. The bootstrap image performs integrity checks of both the firmware images. The primary firmware image (FW2) is prioritized over the backup firmware image (FW1). The primary firmware image is a full-featured firmware supporting all the DMC and PD features. The backup firmware is a reduced-feature firmware image with the ability to update PMG1-S3's primary firmware image from the SPI flash.

**Figure 1. Firmware flowchart**

<img src = "images/dock-firmware-flow.png" width = "500"/>
<br>


The following sections provide a high-level description of the key firmware blocks used in the dock solution:


### PdStack middleware

The PdStack middleware library configures the USBPD block on the PMG1-S3 MCU device to detect Type-C connection state changes and USBPD messages and notify the stack through callback functions. The callback functions are implemented in the PmgAppCommon middleware. The stack also provides notifications of various connection and PD policy state changes so that the rest of the system can be configured as required.

This application uses the "pmg1_pd3_drp_epr_cfg" library variant of PdStack middleware that supports USB Type-C Dual-role EPR operation and USB PD Revision 3.1 messaging along with configurability of library parameters through EZ-PD&trade; Dock Configuration Utility.


### PdUtils middleware

The PdUtils middleware implements the software timer and utility functions required by the PMG1S3 device.


### PdAltMode middleware

The PdAltMode middleware implements state machines to work with different USB PD Alternate modes. The PdAltMode middleware operates on top of the USBPD driver included in the ModusToolbox&trade; PDL CAT2 (mtb-pdl-cat2) Peripheral Driver Library (PDL), PdUtils, and PdStack middlewares. The middleware provides a set of PdAltMode APIs through which the application can initialize, monitor, and configure the PD Alternate mode operation. 

The middleware also supports the Exchange Capabilities feature where depending on the alternate mode entered on the upstream port, the behavior of the downstream port is modified.


### PmgAppCommon middleware

The PmgAppCommon middleware provides a set of files that are essential for a USB-C and Power Delivery application. It implements a set of callback functions that are registered with the PdStack middleware. These ,callback functions are used to perform board-specific tasks such as turning the consumer/provider power path ON/OFF and identifying the optimal source power profile to be used for charging.


### Smart power

The dock solution uses the Smart Power feature for throttling power on the USB-C ports depending on the available power in the dock. PMG1-S3 periodically monitors the power consumed by the dock and adjusts the power on the upstream port depending on the available power.


### USB interface

PMG1-S3 enumerates as a USB device presenting Vendor, HID and Billboard interfaces to the USB host.

- The Vendor interface is used for firmware update.

- The Billboard interface is used to communicate the Alternate modes supported by PMG1-S3 dock to a host system. If the dock is connected to a non-supported host device, a pop-up window shows the information of the device status.

- The HID interface supports the following use cases:
  
  - Sending and receiving custom reports from/to the USB host. This feature is used for the exchange of ETAG information between the host and PMG1-S3 dock.

  - USB suspend and wakeup option using system control HID input reports.

> **Note:** For more information, see the EZ-PDâ„¢ PMG1-S3 Dock SDK user guide.


### DMC firmware update

The DMC firmware update module allows updating of firmware on PMG1-S3 and connected onboard components. The firmware update process is split into two phases:

- **Phase-1:** A composite image is downloaded from the host over the USB Vendor interface to an external SPI flash.

- **Phase-2:** In this phase, PMG1-S3 updates itself and connected onboard components from the downloaded composite image.

EZ-PD&trade; Dock Firmware Update tool is used to send the composite image to the dock and also initiate the Phase-2 update. The dock notifies the tool at the end of Phase-1 completion; it continues its normal operation.
    
The dock initiates the Phase-2 update on receiving a trigger for Phase-2 from the EZ-PD&trade; Dock Firmware Update tool. There are two types of triggers: *Update Now (1)* or *Update on US Disconnection (2)*.


### Debug module

The Debug module is used for logging the failures and events of interest. The module supports the following types of logging:

- **Logging through UART:** The logs are transmitted over UART. The events and failures are prioritized based on the log levels. You can change this log level at compile time using the `CY_APP_DEBUG_LEVEL` macro.

- **Storing logs into internal flash:** The logs are stored in the internal flash of PMG1-S3. The following two types of information are stored into the internal flash:

   - *Static information:* Stores the number of occurrences of predefined failures.
   - *Dynamic information:* Stores the last few failure details into the internal flash.
    
> **Note:** For more information, see the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1-S3 Dock SDK user guide.


### LED control module

The LED control module is used to control LEDs connected to the GPIOs of PMG1-S3.The module can control the LED to work in the following modes.

| Mode          | Description              |
| :------------ | :----------------------- |
| CY_LED_CTRL_LED_OFF | LED is turned OFF |
| CY_LED_CTRL_LED_ON  | LED is turned ON  |
| CY_LED_CTRL_LED_BLINKING | LED is set to blink |
| CY_LED_CTRL_LED_BREATHING | Slow ramp up and down of LED brightness to give a visual breathing effect on the LED |

> **Note:** For more information, see the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1-S3 Dock SDK user guide.

### Buck-boost controller

EZ-PD&trade; PMG1-S3 USB-C dock solution supports external DC-DC buck-boost controllers (MP4247 from Monolithic Power Systems and RT6190 from Richtek Technologies) to supply the required voltage and current. These buck-boost controllers can provide power up to 140 W.

### HPI master

The Host Processor Interface (HPI) protocol allows for communication between an embedded controller (EC) or a host processor and other EZ-PD&trade; CCGx PD controllers. This protocol is based on the master and slave concept, allowing the master to monitor the PD status, change configurations, and perform a firmware update of the slave devices. HPI is implemented over the I2C protocol. In the dock solution, PMG1-S3 acts as the HPI master and other CCGx devices present act as HPI slave devices. The HPI master is provided in the form of a pre-compiled library.

### Adapter detection

Adapter detection is used to find the power rating of the connected adapter. On the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1-S3 USB-C Dock board, this is determined by a combination of jumpers and a resister divider circuit. The module monitors the ADC voltage on a dedicated GPIO and calculates the adapter power based on predetermined voltage levels. See the following table for jumper settings for various power ratings.

| J23    |  J24    | J25     | Adapter power
| :------| :-------| :-------| :---------
| OPEN   | OPEN    | OPEN    | Undefined
| OPEN   | OPEN    | CLOSE   | 120 W
| OPEN   | CLOSE   | OPEN    | 135 W
| OPEN   | CLOSE   | CLOSE   | 150 W
| CLOSE  | OPEN    | OPEN    | 180 W
| CLOSE  | OPEN    | CLOSE   | 200 W
| CLOSE  | CLOSE   | OPEN    | 230 W
| CLOSE  | CLOSE   | CLOSE   | 280 W

<br>

### Flash memory map

The internal flash of PMG1-S3 is used to store a bootstrap image, two firmware images with their corresponding configuration tables and metadata, dock metadata, and telemetry data. The flash memory map for the device is shown in Figure 3.

**Figure 3. Flash layout**

<img src = "images/flash-layout.png" width = "500"/>

<br>

The bootstrap image is allocated a fixed 4 KB of memory at the start of the flash space. This area can only be written to from the SWD interface.

The configuration table holds the default dock configuration for the dock application parameters. It is located at the beginning of each firmware binary and the size of each configuration table is 2560 bytes.

The firmware area is used for the dock firmware application. FW1 uses the space from 4 KB to 68 KB while FW2 uses 68 KB to 252 KB. The remaining space is used for storing debug logs, dock metadata and the metadata of the two firmware images.


### Compile-time configurations

This application functionality can be customized through a set of compile-time parameters that can be turned ON/OFF through the Makefile. See the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1-S3 Dock SDK user guide for more information.
